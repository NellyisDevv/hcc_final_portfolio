        <h4>Created with Adobe Photoshop</h4>
        <p>
          This is one of my first ever adobe photoshop projects! I created a
          flyer for my own Web Design business. The tools used in this project
          where very simple because it was my very first. I used the magnetic
          lasso tool to make a cut out of my body and insert it into the
          background. Also, I used the healing spot tool to clean up some areas
          around my body!

        <h4>Created with Adobe Premier</h4>
        <p>
          This project is a 30 second commercial for a company called "SkyNet."
          They offer a DNS filter and other features to make the internet safer
          for the entire household. This project used many transitions between
          images and videos, while also utilizing background music and slides.

        <h4>Created with Audacity</h4>
        <p>
          This audio recording was the beginning of a podcast speaking about the
          dark sides of technology and how to combat this issues faced. Some
          tools used in this project were audio equalizers to enhance the voice,
          volume control to ensure the background audio didn't ruin the voice
          over. Finally, fading the audio in the beginning and end to make the
          clip sound more natural!

        <h4>Created with InDesign</h4>
        <p>
          During this project we were asked to pick any location and give
          reasons why those areas are a great place to visit. I choose Florida
          and listed some of the biggest cities and gave reasons why those
          cities are great! Some tools I used to create this project where the
          box tools with different properties to give shadow affects, also used
          for the background of text to bring more life to the project.

        <h4>Created with Adobe Illustrator</h4>
        <p>
          This project with InDesign was one of my favorite projects to work on!
          I took one of the only selfies I have (Which is the same selfie used
          in my about page). And turned myself into a cartoon! This process took
          a pretty long time because I had to make sure every brush stroke was
          utilized correctly, even though I had the original image to trace.

        <h4>Created with Adobe Animate</h4>
        <p>
          This project was created using Adobe Animate. The assignment was to
          take a logo and make an animation, I took my name and entered it
          inside of a white box and made it fade out of the frame. Some of the
          fun tools I got to use in animate were the "animation frames," this
          allowed me to change every single frame to personalize it however I
          wanted the animation to look. I used this to make the letters inside
          the bubble show up one by one instead of all at one time!
